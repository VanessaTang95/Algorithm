# Find the Middle of a list in a single pass
## Description
> Given a Singly-Linked List, write a method - findMiddleNode that finds and returns the middle node of the list in a single pass.
## Example
```
1 ==> 1
1->2 ==> 1
1->2->3->4 ==> 2
1->2->3->4->5 ==> 3
```
## Thoughts
* My 1st thoughts is to count the node number of the linked list, then come up with the target index, then get the node(which happened to be similar to the complex fast-slow pointers)

## Solutions
* [Count first]()
* [Fast-Slow pointers]()
