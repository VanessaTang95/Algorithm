# Find the Missing Number in a Set of Numbers from 1 to 10
MicroSoft
## Description
> Given an Array containing 9 numbers ranging from 1 to 10, write a method to find the missing number. Assume you have 9 numbers between 1 to 10 and only one number is missing.
## Example
`findMissingNumber({1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}) --> 3`
## Thoughts
* My 1st thoughts for this problem is trying to use an array to record the occurance of the number
* Math is much more easier

## solution
* [Counts]()
  - T(n)=O(n), S(n)=O(1)
* [Math]()
  - T(n)=O(n), S(n)=O(1)
