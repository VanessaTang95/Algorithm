# Reverse Linked List
Amazon
Address:[LeetCode 206](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
## Description
> Reverse a singly linked list.
## Question to ask
* If it's just said reverse a linked list, then ask, what type is this linked list, circled? singly? double?
* Any constraints ?
* What would be the defination of Node?
* What would the outcome like when some edge case?
*
## Example
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

## My Thoughts
* Swap it? -- close to the iterative one

## Solution
* [Iterative Solution](https://github.com/VanessaTang95/Algorithm/blob/master/LeetCode/Top_Amazon_Interview_Solution/ReverseLinkedList_iterative.java)
  - T(n):O(n)
  - S(n):O(n)
* [recursive Solution](https://github.com/VanessaTang95/Algorithm/blob/master/LeetCode/Top_Amazon_Interview_Solution/ReverseLinkedList_Recursive.java)
  - T(n)=O(n)
  - S(n)=O(n)
