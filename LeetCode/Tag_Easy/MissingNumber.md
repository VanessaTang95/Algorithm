# Missing Number
Address:[LeetCode 268](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)
## Description
> Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

## Examples
* Example 1:
  ```
  Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
  ```
* Example 2:
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
## Note
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## Thoughts
* Before Dive in
  - Allow duplicate?
  - what should be return if the array is null?
  - Is the Array Sorted? Can we sort it?
* Similar to one problem met at Firecode, using simple sum to solve this question

## Solution
* [Math_Sum_Solution]()
* [HashSet_Solution]()
* [Sorted_Array_Solution]()
