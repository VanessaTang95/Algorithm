# Data Structures
## How Computers store data?
* variables stored in RAM(AKA random access memory)
* files stored in storage, data storage is permanent
* while ram lose memory when the computer turns off
* storage runs slow
* cpu compute things
* RAM have address just like index and a shelf of 1 byte(8 bits) storage in binary format
* CPU have memory controller to read shelf contents
* CPU have a cache to store most used/recently used data
* > cache: stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere

## DS to bits
* int - 4 bits
* TBC

## DS IN LANGUAGE
