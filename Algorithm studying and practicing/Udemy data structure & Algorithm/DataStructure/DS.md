# Data Structures
---
## What is Data Structures?
- Something we store or organize data for better usage or processed in an efficient time
- Array, ArrayList, LinkList, HashSet, HashMap, Tree, Graph, etc...

## What is Algorithm?
- is a set of rules to be followed to solve a problem

## Tips on technical interviews
- Product-based companies focus more on DS
- Service-based companies focus more on quick solution(like algorithm)
- Companies use technical interviews to check 3 things
  - candidate have coded before
  - candidate have problem-solving skills
  - candidate have coding/testing skills

## Types of Data Structures
- Primitive DS(DS that programming language defined already)
  - Integer, Float, Character, Boolean
- Non-Primitive DS
  - Physical DS(DS that physically presented in RAM/memory)
    - Array, Linked List
  - Logical DS(Basically are models, they can be implemented/built based on physical DS)
    -Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph
